# My First Post
There are a million and 1 bloggers, but so be it i just want to write down interesting ideas and principles, as a sort of archive for my self to come back to some day, when i have grown wiser and smarter, and maby i can sole them then, besides there is always some one smarter, maybe thay can do something with the ideas.

Shearing is something i like doing to, discussing things with people etc, more minds are always better than one unless, git did not exist the programing alone would be better xD.
